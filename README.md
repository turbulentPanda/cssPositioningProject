# NewsScientist Clone

## Project Goal:

Clone the NewsScientist Article: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2286218-ancient-lake-in-marss-gale-crater-may-have-actually-been-a-small-pond/#top

## Project Motivation:

To practice CSS positioning (i.e., Grid and Flexbox).


## What I Learned:

This was my first time recreating an entire webpage that contained significant detail. It was much more time-consuming and difficult than I had anticipated. In particular, my initial HTML markup and CSS rulesets are lengthy and inefficient. I might use this project as one to practice refactoring code. Once I get more practice, I can shorten the code.

Overall, though, I had a ton of fun with this project! The page isn't completely identical to the original, but I am fairly happy with the result!

## Things to Polish:

Refactoring, mobile compatibility, responsive design (there is none as of yet).
